# Equaltunity
2022 HackViolet hackathon project

## Inspiration
Diversity is crucial for creativity and productivity. However, gender inequality is a common situation in nowadays tech industry and other related fields. According to  National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), women only make up about 25% of the total workforce in technology. Meanwhile, female resumes received by companies are also out of balance. Therefore, we want to promote diversity in the workforce by constructing a platform that will provide an equal proportion of resumes for all genders. 

## What it does
The Equaltunity Application provides both web and mobile interface for candidates to apply for companies they are interested in.
Our database monitors the number of male and female resumes and tries to select the same ratio to companies. We would provide a web interface for companies to pick suitable candidates, hoping to increase the diversity of the company staff.

## How we built it
We use Swift for the IOS mobile application and HTML/CSS for the web interface at this point. We plan to apply React to our front-end framework, use Java for our back-end, and we hope our mobile application can port it to Android soon. We will also deploy our application and web on Google Cloud to receive and interact with users’ requests and store information and data. 

## Challenges we ran into
This is our first hackathon, and, moreover,  our teammates are not that familiar with the tools we use. However, even though we struggle a bit, we still overcame the challenges and built a simple prototype.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what we had build and what we aim to achieve. We are happy to see more female engineers to work in the tech industry.

## What we learned
First, in the past, we were aware of the gender inequality in tech company, but we didn’t really think about how we can improve the situation. With this experience, we were able to come up with new ideas about how we can help within our limit. 


Second, with this experience, we were able to explore the new area that we haven’t tried before, for example, developed mobile application within such short amount of time.

## What's next for Equaltunity
Going forward, when there is official or enough information on the ratio of different gender identities, we would include the data of non-binary genders. Moreover, besides gender, we hope to help different types of minor priorities have more opportunities to create a more diverse and equal workplace.
